# ROS : Simulated Turtlebor3 Burger Project

## Description

This folder contains all the codes we have written to reach the objectives. They are separated within 3 other folders based on the challenges they are related to. There 3 different challenges and 3 tasks for each one :
  - challenge(i)_task(j).py are files that carry tasks out. As said previously, there is a file for each task.
  - challenge(i)_task(j)_world_control.py are files that make some elements interact within our worlds during simulation. For example, 

      Where:
      - `i` represents the challenge.
      - `j` represents the task.

For example, [challenge2_task3.py](challenge2/challenge2_task3.py) is a script associated with task 3 from challenge 2. And [challenge2_task2_world_control.py](challenge2/challenge2_task2_world_control.py) is used for task 2 from challenge 2 and makes the wall move forward and backward.
